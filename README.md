## GUI Usage

### Running the Application
1. **Launch the executable** by double-clicking `windows_optimizer.exe`
2. **Select optimizations** by checking/unchecking the boxes
3. **Review selections** - some optimizations are mandatory for safety
4. **Click "Apply Optimizations"** to start the process
5. **Monitor progress** through the progress bar and log window

### GUI Features
- **Select All / Deselect All** buttons for quick selection
- **Scrollable optimization list** for easy navigation
- **Real-time status updates** during optimization
- **Detailed activity log** for troubleshooting
- **Success/failure notifications** with recommendations

### Command Line Mode
For advanced users or automation, you can still use the command line:

```bash
# Run with GUI (default)
windows_optimizer.exe

# Run in command-line mode (runs all optimizations)
windows_optimizer.exe --cli
```

## Requirements
- **Windows 10/11** operating system
- **Administrator privileges** (required for most optimizations)
- **No additional dependencies** - everything is bundled in the exe

### For Building from Source:
- **Python 3.8+** (only needed for building the exe)
- **PyInstaller** (automatically installed by build scripts)

## Building the Executable

### Method 1: Using Batch File (Recommended)
1. Transfer all files to your Windows machine
2. Right-click on `build_exe.bat`
3. Select "Run as administrator"
4. Wait for the build process to complete
5. Find your executable at `dist\windows_optimizer.exe`

### Method 2: Using PowerShell Script
1. Transfer all files to your Windows machine
2. Right-click on `build_exe.ps1`
3. Select "Run with PowerShell" (as administrator)
4. Wait for the build process to complete
5. Find your executable at `dist\windows_optimizer.exe`

### Method 4: Run Security Scanner Only
For security-focused scanning without full optimization:

```bash
# Run the standalone security scanner
python security_scanner.py

# Or use the batch file
run_security_scan.bat
```

The security scanner provides:
- Malwarebytes installation checking
- Windows Defender status and scanning
- Security recommendations
- Guided setup instructions

## How to Use the Optimizer

### Running the Executable
1. Locate `windows_optimizer.exe` in the `dist` folder
2. **Right-click** on the file
3. Select **"Run as administrator"**
4. The program will run automatically and show progress

### What Happens During Optimization
The tool will perform these operations in sequence:
1. **Safety Check** - Verifies Windows OS and admin privileges
2. **Restore Point** - Creates a system restore point
3. **Cache Cleaning** - Clears various system and browser caches
4. **System Repair** - Runs SFC and DISM scans
5. **Disk Optimization** - Cleans temp files and defragments drives
6. **Performance Tuning** - Optimizes search, power settings, and more

## Important Notes
- ‚ö†Ô∏è **Administrator privileges are required** for most optimizations
- üîÑ **System restore point is created automatically** before changes
- ‚è±Ô∏è **Some operations may take several minutes** to complete
- üîÑ **Restart recommended** after optimization for best results
- üíæ **~500MB free space** recommended for the build process

## Troubleshooting

### Build Issues
- **"Python not found"**: Install Python from [python.org](https://python.org)
- **Permission denied**: Run build scripts as administrator
- **PyInstaller fails**: Try `pip install --upgrade pyinstaller`

### Runtime Issues
- **"Access denied"**: Run the exe as administrator
- **Operations fail**: Some optimizations may require specific Windows versions
- **Antivirus blocks**: Add exception for the exe file

## Disclaimer
‚ö†Ô∏è **Use at your own risk.** While a restore point is created automatically, it's always recommended to:
- Backup important data before running optimization tools
- Test on a non-critical system first
- Review the source code to understand what changes are made
